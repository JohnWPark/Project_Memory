## Project Workflow
Meets expectations. User stories look great. Looks at comments in file about last user story.

## Technical Requirements
Meets Expectations. The application runs. There are a couple of bugs. But overall functionality seems to be good. I would encourage you to figure out how to prevent users from clicking more than once one th same picture. Additionally how we can move some of this code out of the DOM and into the JS.

## Code Quality
Meets expectations. Much of your code is well commented. Theres a bit of extra code floating around, make sure to get rid of extra non used code when moving to production. We can always get it back because it's under version control.

## Problem Solving
Meets expectations. The problem of memory was solved. There are a couple of bugs that need to be worked out


## overall
Great job john. I'm really happy you were able to make it this far. Even though we worked together on a bit of this code, I think the understanding is there. I would encourage you to try and wipe the code for this assignment and try building it again from scratch.
